👋 I'm Cris!

🧠 Driven by a passion for understanding human behavior, my professional journey has led me to specialize in Tech Recruitment, currently working at @Gympass. As a Recruiter, my goal is to craft an exceptional experience for candidates, bridging the gap between extraordinary talents and the specific needs of the business.

💡 Renowned for my creative approach, I tackle my responsibilities with innovation, an open mind, and a strong emphasis on organization and collaboration.

💼 With over 5 years of experience in human resources, my primary focus has been talent attraction. However, I've also navigated through diverse ecosystems, including training and development, climate and culture, and various administrative functions.

📚 My academic foundation includes degrees in Psychology, Human Resources Management, and Business Management with a concentration on behavioral competencies. Complementing my formal education, I've pursued a range of courses in Diversity and Inclusion, Technology Professional Recruitment, and Business Partner operating model.
🙏 Feel free to reach out—I'd love to meet you!
